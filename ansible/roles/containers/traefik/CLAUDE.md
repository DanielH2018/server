# traefik — Reverse proxy, TLS termination & CrowdSec WAF

Edge router for the whole homelab. See repo-root `CLAUDE.md` for shared conventions.
**This role bundles two containers:** `traefik` (version-pinned, Renovate-managed) and the
CrowdSec agent (`crowdsecurity/crowdsec:latest`, `watchtower.enable=false` — it health-gates traefik's
boot, so image updates are deliberate manual pulls). The separate `crowdsec` role is only the
Metabase dashboard.

## At a glance
- **Host:** daniel-server
- **Networks:** proxy · **Authelia:** N/A (provides the forward-auth entrypoint)
- **Depends on:** nothing — **everything else depends on this** (deployed first).
- **Config in:** `ansible/inventory/host_vars/daniel-server.yml` → `containers_list`

## Notable
- TLS via Cloudflare DNS-01; routes services at `<hostname>.<domain>` from their labels.
- CrowdSec bouncer/WAF: `crowdsec-acquis.yaml`, `crowdsec-profiles.yaml`,
  `crowdsec-whitelist.yaml`, Discord alerts, home-IP allowlist updater.
- **Bouncer registration is rotation-safe (2026-07-03, exercised live):** the deploy probes
  LAPI with the configured `crowdsec_bouncer_api_key` and deletes + re-adds `traefik-bouncer`
  on mismatch (`cscli bouncers add` is create-only — without this, a rotated key leaves LAPI
  on the old hash while traefik hot-reloads the new one, and the plugin fails OPEN: silent
  WAF bypass). The auto-created `traefik-bouncer@<bridge-ip>` rows LAPI accumulates (~1 per
  traefik recreate, sharing the parent's key hash) **cannot be pruned individually** — cscli
  refuses, "delete parent instead" — so accumulation between rotations is cosmetic and
  accepted; the rotation-path parent delete cascades the whole set. Rotation runbook:
  `docs/secret-rotation.md` (`assisted`).
- Ships **systemd units** (`traefik-init.service`, `docker-user-rules.service`) and
  logrotate — this role does more than run a container.
- The `labels()` macro imported by every other service's compose lives in the repo-level
  shared templates (`ansible/templates/traefik.yml.j2`) — NOT this role's
  `templates/traefik.yml.j2`, which is Traefik's *static config* (entrypoints, providers).
- **Wildcard default cert covers hand-rolled / path-bypass routers — don't re-flag a missing
  `certresolver` on them (review Network-L2, false positive).** `config.yml.j2`'s default TLS store
  sets a `defaultGeneratedCert` via the cloudflare resolver with SANs `*.<domain>` + `*.local.<domain>`.
  The secondary routers some services hand-roll for a path (`n8n-webhook`, `healthchecks-ping`,
  `karakeep-api`) carry `tls=true` with NO `certresolver` — that's fine: TLS cert selection is by
  **SNI (hostname), before path routing**, so they serve the same valid LE wildcard the co-hosted
  main router already provisions (verified: all three serve `CN=daniel-hunter.com`, issuer Let's
  Encrypt). Adding `certresolver` to them would only trigger redundant per-host ACME requests for
  zero gain. A NEW hand-rolled router on a NEW host not under the wildcard would still need one.

- **Dynamic config (`config.yml.j2`) is bind-mounted via its PARENT DIRECTORY
  (`./data/dynamic:/dynamic:ro`, `providers.file.directory: /dynamic`), not as a single
  file.** Ansible's `template` module writes via tmp+rename, so a re-render swaps in a
  new inode; a single-file bind mount (the old `./data/config.yml:/config.yml:ro` +
  `filename:`) stays pinned to the OLD inode, so Traefik's file-provider `watch: true`
  never fires and even a full re-render is invisible until the container is recreated.
  A directory mount follows directory entries, so renames within it are visible and
  watch actually works — config.yml edits now apply live, no recreate needed (unlike
  `traefik.yml`, still read only at boot, still in the `common_config_changed` OR).

## Editing
- Compose: `templates/docker-compose.yml.j2` · Static cfg: `templates/traefik.yml.j2` · Dynamic cfg: `templates/config.yml.j2` (renders to `data/dynamic/config.yml`)
- Deploy: `uv run ansible-playbook ansible/deploy.yml --tags "traefik"`
