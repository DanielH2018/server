# home-assistant — Home automation platform

LinuxServer.io Home Assistant. See repo-root `CLAUDE.md` for shared conventions.

## At a glance
- **Image:** `lscr.io/linuxserver/homeassistant:latest` (LSIO is x86-64-maintained;
  only the 32-bit ARM variant was deprecated — fine for daniel-server)
- **Host:** daniel-server · **Port:** 8123 · **Networks:** apps + ups · **Authelia:** no
  (`ups` = isolation net to the `nut` sidecar's upsd:3493 for the NUT integration;
  `apps` stays networks[0] so the Traefik label binds to it)
- **Depends on:** traefik
- **Config in:** `ansible/inventory/host_vars/daniel-server.yml` → `containers_list`

## Notable
- **Auth: HA's own login, NOT Authelia.** `use_authelia: false` is deliberate —
  Authelia forward-auth breaks the HA companion mobile app, webhooks, and long-lived
  API tokens (none can complete the portal login flow). The route still gets Traefik
  TLS + CrowdSec + per-router rate-limiting; harden the gate inside HA (strong
  password + TOTP). If you ever want Authelia on the *web UI only*, you'd need
  per-path bypass rules for `/api/`, `/auth/`, and the webhook paths.
- **HACS preinstalled** via `DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:homeassistant-hacs`
  (LSIO Docker mod that drops the Home Assistant Community Store into `/config`).
- **`configuration.yaml` is templated** from `configuration.yaml.j2` to `./config`.
  It sets `use_x_forwarded_for: true` + `trusted_proxies: 172.16.0.0/12` so HA honors
  Traefik's `X-Forwarded-For` (without it HA rejects the proxied request with
  "400 Bad Request"). The template task is wired to `common_config_changed`, so editing
  it recreates the container on the next deploy. **Note:** HA may rewrite parts of its
  own config via the UI, but this file is the Ansible source of truth and is
  overwritten on deploy — keep UI-managed config (integrations, etc.) in the areas HA
  stores separately (`.storage/`, the recorder DB…), which are NOT templated.
- **Automations + scenes + scripts + template sensors ARE copy'd (since 2026-06-18).**
  `files/automations.yaml`, `files/scenes.yaml`, `files/scripts.yaml`, and `files/templates.yaml`
  are static files deployed by `ansible.builtin.copy` (NOT `template` — they use HA `{{ }}` Jinja
  that Ansible's templater would try to render and fail; `copy` ships them verbatim, no `{% raw %}`
  needed). **This is why HA Jinja lives in copy'd files, never inline in `configuration.yaml.j2`**
  (which IS Ansible-templated) — `template: !include templates.yaml` pulls the template sensors in.
  Git is the source of truth; HA UI edits are overwritten on deploy. Both feed `common_config_changed`, so an
  edit recreates HA (~120s). First automation: Hue Tap Dial (RDM002) drives the
  `light.bedroom_lights` group (dial = brightness, button 1 = smart toggle, buttons 2-3 =
  scenes, button 4 = natural-state reset → `script.bedroom_apply_natural`, see below). Presence
  (FP300) + an `input_boolean` manual-off override + an alarm-driven morning reset live in the
  same file; `bedroom_presence_on` and the morning reset BOTH call `script.bedroom_apply_natural`.
  Presence-on's lux gate is window-aware: `in morning window OR illuminance < 50` — wake regardless
  of ambient light during the 15-min window, gate on darkness afterwards. The window now reads
  `sensor.bedroom_wake_start` (the shared dynamic-wake source — see below), the SAME sensor the
  dispatcher's morning exception uses, so the two are inherently in sync (no duplicated formula).
  **Verification gotcha:** an automation's `entity_id` derives from its `alias` (slugified) at
  first creation, NOT its `id` — so `bedroom_fan_temperature` (id) is
  `automation.bedroom_fan_temperature_control` (alias) in the state machine / recorder DB. Query by
  the alias-slug, not the id, when checking whether an automation loaded.
- **Adaptive Lighting is a HACS dependency (since 2026-06-18).** `configuration.yaml` declares
  `adaptive_lighting:` for the bedroom group; the integration code installs via HACS into
  `custom_components/adaptive_lighting/` (Kopia-backed, not templated — like `dreo`). Install it
  via HACS BEFORE deploying, or HA logs "integration not found" and skips the block. The deploy's
  full restart loads a newly added custom component (a YAML "Quick Reload" does not).
- **`files/scripts.yaml` — the "natural lighting state" dispatcher (templated via `copy`, like
  automations/scenes; wired via `script: !include scripts.yaml`; feeds `common_config_changed`).**
  `script.bedroom_apply_natural` sets the bedroom group to what it would be with no manual
  intervention RIGHT NOW: an ordered `choose:` of time-based **exceptions** (brightness overrides
  on AL's natural color) with **full Adaptive Lighting (color + brightness) as `default:`**. The
  The FIRST exception is the night-time dim nightlight (`scene.bedroom_nightlight`) when
  `bedroom_sleep_mode` is on OR it's 00:00–05:00 — so a presence re-trigger overnight doesn't blast
  you (it wins over the wake ramp; at wake time sleep_mode is cleared and hour≥5, so it's false).
  The morning wake (1%→50% over the 15 min ENDING at the real alarm) is the next exception, its window
  = `sensor.bedroom_wake_start .. +15 min` (dynamic — see the dynamic-wake bullet below), encoded
  as `brightness = 1+(50-1)·elapsed/900` over `transition = 900-elapsed` — so `elapsed=0` equals
  the wake's start and pressing button 4 mid-window *resumes* the ramp. **Both Tap Dial button 4
  and the `bedroom_morning_reset` automation call this dispatcher** (single source of truth — no
  duplicated ramp math). Color temp ALWAYS comes from AL; exceptions override brightness only.
  Helper `script.bedroom_set_natural_brightness(brightness_pct, transition)` holds the AL
  release + color-apply boilerplate so a new exception is just a `(condition, brightness,
  transition)` triple dropped above `default:` — see the worked example comment in the file.
- **Threshold alerts — unified engine (since 2026-06-18).** `configuration.yaml` defines twelve
  built-in `threshold` binary-sensors; the platform's native hysteresis (on past bound±hyst) IS the
  "alert once + recovery, no bounce" lifecycle. ALL feed ONE automation `bedroom_threshold_alert`
  (files/automations.yaml) in four **categories** — air quality (CO2/PM2.5/VOC/NOx, `upper`),
  **air quality SEVERE** (same 4 at a higher cutoff), battery (FP300/Tap Dial, `lower`), humidity
  (high `upper` + low `lower`). The category is encoded in each trigger `id` (`<cat>_bad`/`<cat>_ok`);
  everything else (label/value/unit, message, coalescing `tag`) is derived generically from the
  triggering sensor. Per-category differences live in a Jinja `cfg` map: `pulse` (red light flash —
  air quality only, via `script.bedroom_alert_pulse` when lights on), `watch` (wrist buzz), `pierce`
  (sound through DND — **severe air quality only**), `recovery` (send a "back to normal" notice —
  severe skips it; the moderate recovery covers it). **All notify routes through `script.bedroom_notify`**
  (DND/sleep-aware — see the notification-routing bullet). **Anchored on `off`↔`on` (not `unknown`)**
  so an HA restart while bad doesn't re-alert and an unavailable source can't false-alert (offline is
  `bedroom_sensor_offline_alert`'s job). Per-category debounce: air quality 30s, battery 1m, humidity
  5m. The label-strip is `friendly_name | replace(' high','') | replace(' low','') | replace(' severe','')`.
  **Adding a metric** = one threshold sensor + add it to its category's two trigger lists; a **new
  category** = two trigger blocks + one `cfg` entry. Thresholds (incl. the severe cutoffs CO2 2000 /
  PM2.5 100 / VOC 400 / NOx 200) are starting points — tune in the ~2026-06-25 pass.
- **Notification routing — `script.bedroom_notify` (since 2026-06-18).** The single cross-cutting
  layer EVERY bedroom alert calls (threshold engine, sensor-offline, away). Fields:
  `title, message, tag, watch, pierce` (last two default false). Computes the Android `channel` +
  `importance` from `pierce` and the live **"quiet"** state (`sensor.pixel_9_pro_do_not_disturb_sensor`
  not `off` OR `input_boolean.bedroom_sleep_mode` on): `pierce` → high-importance "Bedroom critical"
  channel (sounds, can bypass DND); else "Bedroom alerts", **low/silent while quiet**, default
  otherwise. `watch` → also `notify.pixel_watch_3`. **One-time phone setup:** mark the "Bedroom
  critical" channel as a DND exception in Android (after the first critical alert creates it) — high
  importance alone doesn't pierce DND. Only **severe air quality** sets `pierce`; sensor-offline +
  air-quality set `watch`; battery/humidity/recoveries are routine (silent while quiet, phone-only).
- **Actionable notifications (since 2026-06-18).** `bedroom_notify` takes an optional `actions` list
  (`[{action, title}]`, phone-only) → the companion app renders buttons; taps fire
  `mobile_app_notification_action`, dispatched by `automation.bedroom_notification_action` on the
  namespaced `BEDROOM_*` action id. Wired buttons: air-quality bad → **Boost fan**
  (`BEDROOM_BOOST_FAN`: fan_manual on + 100% — persists until button-3/morning reset; moves air,
  doesn't lower CO2); away "Left on" → **Turn back on** (`BEDROOM_AWAY_TURN_ON`: apply_natural +
  apply_fan, ignores home-gates — undo a false-away); and a nightly **bedtime prompt**
  (`automation.bedroom_bedtime_prompt`, 22:00 if present + not in sleep mode + home) → **Start now**
  (`BEDROOM_START_BEDTIME` → `script.bedroom_bedtime`). Add a button = pass `actions` to
  `bedroom_notify` + a case in the dispatcher.
- **Update-available digest (since 2026-06-18).** `automation.update_available_digest` (homelab-wide,
  no `bedroom_` prefix) — Sunday 10:00, notifies a digest of any `update.*` entity that is `on`
  (Zigbee/sensor firmware + HACS integrations — the gap Renovate doesn't cover; LSIO container HA has
  no `update.home_assistant_*`). Generic over `states.update | selectattr('state','eq','on')` so new
  devices join automatically; gated to only fire when ≥1 update is pending. **Notify-only — never
  auto-flashes.** Routine via `bedroom_notify`. Zigbee versions/names are opaque (build ints / IEEE)
  until devices are renamed in Z2M.
- **Unexpected-occupancy tripwire (since 2026-06-18).** `automation.bedroom_unexpected_occupancy` —
  FP300 presence `off→on` (`for: 30s`) while `person.daniel` is away (not home/unknown/unavailable)
  **and** has been away >5 min → a security alert via `bedroom_notify` (`watch: true, pierce: true`).
  Edge-triggered so a GPS glitch while you're physically present can't fire it (presence already on);
  the >5-min guard filters brief away-glitches; the fan is off while away (no airflow false-positive).
  Pure logic over two trusted sensors — pairs with the home/away work.
- **Sensor-offline alerts (since 2026-06-18).** `bedroom_sensor_offline_alert` (files/automations.yaml,
  a structural twin of the air-quality alert) notifies `notify.mobile_app_pixel_9_pro` when a
  bedroom-automation dependency goes `unavailable` for 5 min, with a coalescing-tag recovery notice.
  Routed through `script.bedroom_notify` (offline: `watch:true` — wrist buzz, but routine for DND, so
  a dropout overnight doesn't wake you; recovery: routine, phone-only).
  Watched (one representative entity per device — Z2M flips all of a device's entities together):
  `sensor.bedroom_airgradient_one_carbon_dioxide`, `binary_sensor.aqara_fp300_presence`,
  `sensor.0x001788010f0ccda4_battery` (Tap Dial), `fan.tower_fan`. **Required dependency: Z2M
  availability must be ON** (enabled 2026-06-18 in the zigbee2mqtt role) — without it the battery
  Zigbee devices (FP300, Tap Dial) never go `unavailable` and this automation can't see them fail.
  Two reusable gotchas: (1) the 5-min `for:` rides out HA/Z2M restarts + the ~120s deploy recreate;
  (2) an entity's `friendly_name` attribute is EMPTY while `unavailable`, so the human name is read
  from the AVAILABLE side of the transition (`from_state` for offline, `to_state` for recovery,
  `default(entity_id)` fallback). Battery-Zigbee offline detection is inherently coarse (~the Z2M
  passive timeout, 60 min), not minutes — a sleeping radio can't be pinged. Adding a watched device
  = add its entity to BOTH trigger lists.
- **Home/away automations (since 2026-06-18).** Off `person.daniel` (HA person entity over
  `device_tracker.pixel_9_pro` GPS/Wi-Fi — a different layer than the FP300's ROOM presence).
  `bedroom_away` (two triggers, both `from:"home"`: `leave` at `for:10m`, `failsafe` at `for:30m`)
  turns off `light.bedroom_lights` + `fan.tower_fan` and notifies what was on; silent if nothing
  was on. `bedroom_arrive_home` (`to:"home"`) nudges the fan back (via `script.bedroom_apply_fan`)
  and re-checks lights only if FP300-present (no forced-on). **Load-bearing detail: every on-path
  is gated on `person.daniel == home`** — `bedroom_fan_temperature` + `bedroom_presence_on` get a
  `person home` condition, and `bedroom_morning_reset` wraps its DIRECT `apply_fan` call in
  `if person home` (it bypasses the fan automation's gate). Miss any one and the fan/lights switch
  on in an empty house. **Overrides (`bedroom_manual_off`/`bedroom_fan_manual`) are never written by
  home/away logic** — leave-off is unconditional, arrive routes through the apply_* scripts which
  read the overrides. Known gap: an HA restart while already away misses the `from:"home"` triggers
  (no live transition); the gates still prevent away-on so it self-corrects. Prereq for the
  unexpected-occupancy tripwire backlog item.
- **Bedtime / sleep routine (since 2026-06-18).** `script.bedroom_bedtime` (the shared "going to
  sleep" action) engages `input_boolean.bedroom_sleep_mode` (a quiet fan cap), flips AL into sleep
  mode (`switch.adaptive_lighting_bedroom_adaptive_lighting_sleep_mode_bedroom`, warm/dim), sets
  `scene.bedroom_nightlight` (amber 3%), and re-applies the fan. Triggered by `automation.bedroom_bedtime`
  off `binary_sensor.pixel_watch_3_bedtime_mode` → on (gated `person.daniel == home`), with **Tap
  Dial button-1 HOLD** as the manual fallback (`bedroom_tap_dial_control`). **Charging is deliberately
  NOT a trigger** (operator charges in-room). **Fan stays temperature-responsive, just quieter:**
  `bedroom_apply_fan` caps the band to Low (1) when `bedroom_sleep_mode` is on — layered on the
  existing 22:00–06:00 Medium (2) night cap, via `cap = 1 if sleep else (2 if night else 3)`; it does
  NOT freeze the fan. `bedroom_morning_reset` unwinds both sleep_mode + AL sleep mode before its fan/
  light re-applies (later moves to the watch-alarm wake). Phone bedtime/sleep sensors (DND,
  sleep_confidence, next_alarm) are now enabled in the companion app; the watch exposes
  `sensor.pixel_watch_3_next_alarm` (the real wake alarm) + `notify.pixel_watch_3`.
- **Dynamic morning wake (since 2026-06-18).** The wake ramp is driven by the real alarm, not a
  hardcoded time. `sensor.bedroom_wake_start` (a `device_class: timestamp` template sensor in
  `files/templates.yaml`) = `sensor.pixel_watch_3_next_alarm − 15 min`, `availability:` gated to
  MORNING alarms only (local hour 03:00–11:00) so a nap/evening alarm never arms it. It's the SINGLE
  source of truth for the wake window `[wake_start, alarm)`: `bedroom_morning_reset` time-triggers
  `at: sensor.bedroom_wake_start` (id `alarm`), and both `bedroom_apply_natural`'s morning exception
  and `bedroom_presence_on`'s window read it (the old triplicated 06:00/07:00 formula + weekday/weekend
  split are GONE). `bedroom_morning_reset` also has a `09:00` `fallback` trigger that clears the
  overnight overrides (sleep mode, AL sleep, manual-off, fan-manual) on no-alarm days WITHOUT forcing
  lights; only the `alarm` trigger runs the ramp. **Uses the WATCH alarm** (`pixel_watch_3`), not the
  phone's (unreliable). Watch caveat moot now — set alarms anywhere; only morning ones wake.
- **Temperature → fan control (since 2026-06-18).** `script.bedroom_apply_fan` (in
  `files/scripts.yaml`) drives `fan.tower_fan` (DREO, 9 levels) from
  `sensor.bedroom_airgradient_one_temperature` (°F): off <72 / Low 72–74 / Medium 74–76 / High ≥76,
  mapped to fan **levels 2/4/6 (≈22/44/67%)**, with a **0.5°F hysteresis deadband** (steps down only
  0.5° below a boundary) and a **22:00–06:00 Medium night cap**. Works in fan LEVELS, not raw %,
  because the DREO integration `math.ceil()`s a requested % up to the next level (a `67%` request
  lands on level 7 ≈ 77%) — send `(L−0.5)/9·100`% to hit level L; speeds tune via one `levels` list.
  Same script-computes / caller-gates split as the lights:
  `bedroom_fan_temperature` (triggers on temp change + 22:00 + 06:00) gates on
  `input_boolean.bedroom_fan_manual` then calls the script. `bedroom_fan_manual_detect` sets that
  override on a real manual change. **`parent_id is none` alone self-trips** here — `dreo` is
  `cloud_push` and its setters only `_send_command` (no optimistic state), so our OWN command's
  value arrives via a parent-less websocket echo that looks manual. Fix: `bedroom_apply_fan` writes
  the level it's about to command to `input_number.bedroom_fan_expected_level` first, and the
  detector flags only when `parent_id is none AND (preset change OR new fan level != expected)` — so
  our echo (level == expected) is ignored, a real manual/remote change is caught. The RF remote is
  caught too (the fan reports app/panel/remote changes to the DREO cloud).
  **Tap Dial button 3 = reset the fan to automatic** (clear `bedroom_fan_manual` + apply, night-cap
  aware); the morning reset clears it too. The `bedroom_relax` scene remains defined but is no longer
  bound to the dial. Adding a pollutant-style fan band = edit the band ladder in the script only.
- **YAML dashboard + entity customization (templated).** `configuration.yaml` registers a YAML
  dashboard via `lovelace: dashboards:` (NOT the legacy top-level `mode: yaml` — deprecated,
  removed in HA 2026.8) pointing at `config/ui-lovelace.yaml` (`templates/ui-lovelace.yaml.j2`),
  shown in the sidebar as "Bedroom". `homeassistant: customize: !include customize.yaml` holds
  friendly-name/icon overrides (`templates/customize.yaml.j2`). Both feed `common_config_changed`,
  so an edit recreates HA (~120s). Built-in cards only — no Lovelace `resources:`/`resource_mode:`.
  **The landing dashboard is NOT YAML-configurable:** HA opens its auto-generated areas "Overview"
  unless "Bedroom" is set as default in the UI (Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → "Set as default for
  everyone" → persists in `.storage/core.config` `default_panel`, Kopia-backed). **Fast loop for
  dashboard-only tweaks:** edit the rendered file and Developer Tools → YAML → **Reload Lovelace**
  (no HA restart). Dashboard entity IDs are exact as of 2026-06-17 (UPS / DREO Tower Fan / Aqara FP300).
- **All persistent state is `./config` → `/config`** (Kopia-backed): the SQLite
  recorder DB, `.storage/`, secrets, automations, and the templated `configuration.yaml`.
- **Bridge networking, not host.** Cloud/API-based integrations work fine. **Local
  device discovery** (mDNS/SSDP, Bluetooth, Zigbee/Z-Wave USB dongles) generally needs
  `network_mode: host` and/or `devices:` passthrough — which is incompatible with the
  Traefik-label + bridge-network setup here. Switching to host mode is a separate,
  larger change; revisit only if you add local hardware.
