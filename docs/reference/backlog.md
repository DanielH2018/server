# Backlog

Findings Claude confirmed and did not fix in the session that found them, filed through `scripts/dev/findings.py` and labelled `claude` on GitHub. A row that has been seen three times carries **escalated** (the filing plus two re-observations) and needs a durable owner: a test, a hook or a CLAUDE.md rule. Close one from a PR body with `Closes #<n>`. A row marked in the Verify-by column carries a description of how to check it in its issue body — run `findings.py verify --all` to print them. That command reports and runs nothing; closing stays with `findings.py close`.
