# Host packages — the operator runbook

The host-package pipeline builds `homelab-*` Debian packages from master on daniel-box, signs
them, and serves them as an apt repository at `http://<daniel-box server_ip>:8791`. The
Ansible role `homelab_builder` installs the builder half on daniel-box; its rules are in
`ansible/roles/setup/homelab_builder/CLAUDE.md`, and its design is in
[the H3 plan](target-architecture/host/h3-pi-pilot.md).

This page holds the procedures an operator runs when the pipeline stops. It starts with two:
clearing a deployer hold, and the two host-plane pages. The plan's PR H3.5b adds the rest: the
host holds, the builder hold, a host rollback, key rotation and the five builder pages.

## Clearing a deployer hold that a failed `homelab_builder` or `gitops_deploy` apply wrote

The GitOps tick applies `homelab_builder` on daniel-box through the setup plane. From PR H3.5a
the same tick applies `gitops_deploy` as well. Every broad arm of the deployer is
forward-only, so a failed apply leaves the tree merged and writes two records:

- `hold_sha` in `/var/lib/gitops-deploy/`, which names the SHA that failed;
- one `hold_plane` line in `/var/lib/gitops-deploy/owed.jsonl` for each playbook and tag set
  that failed.

While the hold stands, `land.sh` reports `deploy-failed` for every session's landing, and
**GitOps Deploy — Status** pages. Each apply that can fail this way merges in an attended
window for that reason.

To clear the hold:

1. **Merge a fix, or the disarm, as its own PR.** The disarm is
   `homelab_builder_enabled: false` in `ansible/roles/setup/homelab_builder/defaults/main.yml`.
   The tick applies the role. An apply that covers every held plane clears `hold_sha` with no
   further step.
2. **If that apply fails too, list what the hold names.** On daniel-box, read the held SHA
   and every `hold_plane` line:

    ```bash
    cat /var/lib/gitops-deploy/hold_sha
    grep '"hold_plane"' /var/lib/gitops-deploy/owed.jsonl
    ```

    The list can name `homelab_builder`, `gitops_deploy` or both.
3. **Operator-only: apply each named plane by hand.** The play's `load_secrets` `pre_task`
   decrypts, so an agent session cannot run this step. From the primary checkout on
   daniel-box:

    ```bash
    uv run ansible-playbook ansible/initial_setup.yml --tags homelab_builder,gitops_deploy
    ```

    Name only the tags the hold lists.
4. **Clear the hold.** A hand `ansible-playbook` run is not the deployer, so it clears
   nothing on its own. Once every held plane is applied, run:

    ```bash
    uv run python scripts/deploy_tools/gitops_state.py clear-hold <full hold_sha>
    ```

    The command refuses unless the SHA is the one held. It removes `hold_sha` and every
    `hold_plane` line together. [The GitOps pipeline](gitops-pipeline.md)'s *Which apply
    clears a hold* states the coverage rule.

Never `rm` `hold_sha`. That leaves its `hold_plane` lines in the ledger with nothing that
names them, and `clear-hold --orphaned` is then the only way to drop them.

## Host-plane pages

Two Alertmanager rules in observability's `host-checks` group page on a host's updater. Each
carries `severity="critical"` and the host's name as `service`, and the alert's description
names what to read first.

- **`HostReconcileFailed`** fires when `homelab_host_reconcile_ok` has read 0 on a host for 15
  minutes. The updater writes 0 on every run while the host holds after a failed reconcile,
  so the host installs nothing newer until the hold clears. Read `journalctl -u
  homelab-updater -u homelab-reconcile` on the host and fix the cause. Then clear the hold
  with one of the updater's two levers, run as root on the host:
    - `/usr/lib/homelab/homelab-updater --clear-hold` reruns reconcile against the installed
      packages and clears the hold if it passes;
    - `/usr/lib/homelab/homelab-updater --clear-hold --install-newest` clears the hold, then
      installs the newest packages and reconciles as a timer run does. Use it when the fix is
      a newer package.
- **`HostUpdateStale`** fires when a host listed in
  `ansible/roles/k8s/observability/defaults/main.yml:observability_expected_hosts` reports no
  successful update within its `limit_seconds`. It also fires when the host's exporter is up
  and serves no success timestamp. A failed fetch writes no metric, so an unreachable
  repository, a stopped `homelab-apt-repo.service`, a firewall rule, a keyring mismatch and a
  stopped timer all end here. Read `systemctl status homelab-updater.timer` and `journalctl -u
  homelab-updater` on the host. A dead exporter does not fire it: that host's `up` at 0 keeps
  the rule quiet.

Each limit exceeds the longest gap between two of the host's updater fires plus the updater's
`TimeoutStartSec`, so one failed fetch never pages.
`scripts/renderer/tests/test_renderer_host_update_limits.py` fails a limit the host's rendered
schedule outgrows. The map is empty until H3.9c adds daniel-pi.
