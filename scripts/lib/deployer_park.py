"""Whether the GitOps deployer is PARKED behind origin/master, read from its own marker.

TWO READERS ASK THIS AND MUST ANSWER IT IDENTICALLY. The SessionStart banner
(``.claude/hooks/session-health.py``) reaches a session at the moment it opens.
``scripts/deploy_tools/deploy_staleness.py`` reaches a session that has been running for an
hour and hits ``deploy.sh`` exit 4 mid-landing, where the refusal names a rebase of the
reader's own worktree — the wrong repair when the primary checkout is what has to converge
(issue #1429). A second derivation of "is this a park?" would drift, and the two would then
disagree about the same marker on the same host.

``behind_since`` holds ``"<origin_sha> <unix_ts_first_seen>"`` while the host is behind
origin/master, and the stamp survives across ticks — it resets only on convergence. So its
age is how long the deployer has declined to converge, not how long ago the last tick ran.

Stdlib only, and no imports from this repo: the SessionStart hook imports it before anything
else is on ``sys.path``.
